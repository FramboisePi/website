  Extensions for the application are developed and maintained by the community. These currently consist of sources for pulling content into the app, but in the near future, this will also include manga tracker implementations.
  Get started with our [source development guide](extension-development/).

 * **Paperback website**  
  Any help improving this [website](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/) is definitely welcome.

 * **Paperback extensions-common**  
   Common models and type definitions for developing a Paperback source.

 * **Paperback CLI**  
   Our CLI tool to bundle extensions repositories.
