Because of this, the local townsfolk never venture outside at night. Legend has it that a demon slayer also roams the night, hunting down these bloodthirsty demons.\nEver since the death of his father, Tanjirou has taken it upon himself to support his mother and five siblings. Although their lives may be hardened by tragedy, they've found happiness. But that ephemeral warmth is shattered one day when Tanjirou finds his family slaughtered and the lone survivor, his sister Nezuko, turned into a demon. Adding to this sorrow, a demon hunter named Tomioka Giyuu arrived and was about to finish Nezuko off, but to his surprise she and Tanjiro started to protect each other.

Their daily lives involve rigorous tests, but afterwards, they are allowed to play outside. \n\nThere is only one rule they must obey: do not leave the orphanage. But one day, two top-scoring orphans, Emma and Norman, venture past the gate and unearth the horrifying reality behind their entire existence: they are all livestock, and their orphanage is a farm to cultivate food for a mysterious race of demons. With only a few months left to pull off an escape plan, the children must somehow change their predetermined fate.\n\n","follows":26227,"views":739701,"author":"Shirai Kaiu","users":1458,"langFlag":"jp","lastUpdate":"2020-05-31T20:01:13.000Z","covers":["https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v1.250.jpg?1545780367","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v2.250.jpg?1545780383","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v3.250.jpg?1545780391","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v4.250.jpg?1545780398","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v5.250.jpg?1545780406","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v6.250.jpg?1545780415","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v7.250.jpg?1545780424","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v8.250.jpg?1545780431","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v9.250.jpg?1545780439","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v10.250.jpg?1545780448","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v11.250.jpg?1545780456","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v12.250.jpg?1545780520","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v13.250.jpg?1550756193","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v14.250.jpg?1558437938","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v15.250.jpg?1564581968","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v16.250.jpg?1570027760","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v17.250.jpg?1577297348","https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/covers\/19531v18.250.jpg?1582714613"],"tags":[{"id":"content","label":"Content","tags":[{"id":"49","value":"Gore"}]},{"id":"demographic","label":"Demographic","tags":[{"id":"1","value":"Shounen"}]},{"id":"format","label":"Format","tags":[{"id":"4","value":"Award Winning"}]},{"id":"genre","label":"Genre","tags":[{"id":"2","value":"Action"},{"id":"8","value":"Drama"},{"id":"14","value":"Horror"},{"id":"20","value":"Mystery"},{"id":"22","value":"Psychological"}]},{"id":"theme","label":"Theme","tags":[{"id":"60","value":"Demons"},{"id":"34","value":"Supernatural"},{"id":"77","value":"Survival"}]}],"titles":["Yakusoku no Neverland","The Promised Neverland","Обещанный Неверленд","Якусоку но Нэба:рандо","أرض الأحلام الموعودة","約束のネバーランド","约定的梦幻岛","약속의 네버랜드"],"image":"https:\/\/mangadex.org\/images\/manga\/19531.jpg?1583165427","relatedManga":[],"hentai":false,"langName":"Japanese","artist":"Demizu Posuka","status":1,"avgRating":8.8000000000000007},"sourceId":"MangaDex"},{"object":{"rating":9.8000000000000007,"id":"hige-wo-soru-soshite-joshikosei-wo-hirou-shimesaba","description":"Yoshida was swiftly rejected by his crush of 5 years.
