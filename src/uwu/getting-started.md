## Installation

::: tip Video tutorial
 If you prefer using a video tutorial, Artesians made a beautiful one. You will find it... Oh oh, forgot we took it down ðŸ˜­: we are really concerned by our users privacy.

::: warning Warning
  The installation is really difficult! Luckily we have a beautiful website which is fully PWA compliant. Forget about the app, you just need to press the "Install the app" notification on your phone.

### AltStore instructions for Mac
1. Download **`Paperback.ipa`**
1. Try to open it on your phone, that won't work.
1. Just ask for help in #support

## FAQ

### How to install it on Android?
Will the app work on Android? Maybe, ping Paper on Discord to check.

### App crashes on launch
It's a **bug**! Just go to #feedback channel on Discord and ask:
> "paperback keeps on crashing when i open it, what should i do??"

### What type of business model will you take on?
There are no plans to adopt a formal business model but Paper is thinking of buying a new car thus it would be nice to get support for development of the app.

### I can't find the fancy page reader
It's normal: Paper didn't like it so he decided to remove it.

### I have some other issue that isn't listed here
It's not possible, everything had been listed here. The #support channel is not designed to help people who did not read this guide.
